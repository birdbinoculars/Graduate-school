Some of my SQL assignments from my data analytics certificate program at Tufts. Course taught by Prof. Leo Hsu.

- _Grade Calculator_
=> scale my quiz/homework scores appropriately to calculate my final grade for the class (adding attendance and final projects points as scalar at the end)

- _Hypothetical airline_ => build and fill a database for a hypothetical airline company, and query said database

- _Hypothetical dental office_ => build and fill a database for a hypothetical dental office
